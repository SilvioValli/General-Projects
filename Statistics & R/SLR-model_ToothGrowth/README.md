<h2>Description</h2>
Application of a SLR model to the "ToothGrowth" data set within Rstudio environment.
The primary goal is to explore the linear relationship between a single explanatory variable and a response variable through statistical modeling and diagnostic evaluation.

Brief summary of the topics covered:

- <b>ðŸ“œSLR ASSUMPTIONS:</b> we begin by outlining the key assumptions underlying linear regression, including linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals
- <b>ðŸ“ˆOLS, F-TEST, RESIDUALS and PEARSON :</b> SLR model is applied to the data, followed by the estimation of the model coefficients, Î²0 (intercept) and Î²1(slope), using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. We provide confidence intervals for both coefficients and test the significance of Î²1 using the F-test and t-statistic, thereby evaluating the strength of the linear relationship. We also assess model fit and residual behavior, incorporating jackknife resampling and the Pearson correlation for further validation.
- <b>ðŸ”¢LINEAR ALGEBRA kicks in:</b> The project includes a brief overview of the linear algebra behind the regression, including the design matrix, estimation formulas, and variance calculations. Finally, we interpret the confidence interval for Î²1 to understand the reliability of the slope estimate.
